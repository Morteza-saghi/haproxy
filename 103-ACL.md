# HAProxy Access Control Lists (ACLs)

In HAProxy, an **Access Control List (ACL)** is a powerful mechanism used to define conditions for making routing and filtering decisions. ACLs help inspect client requests and apply specific actions based on those conditions.

## How ACLs Work in HAProxy

1. **Define the ACL** – You specify a condition to check (e.g., request path, headers, source IP, etc.).
2. **Use the ACL in an Action** – You apply a rule based on the ACL evaluation (e.g., allow, deny, redirect, choose a backend, etc.).

## Syntax for ACLs

```
acl <name> <condition>
<name> → The name of the ACL.
<condition> → The condition being checked.
Example:

```
acl is_admin path_beg /admin
```

This ACL checks if the request path starts with /admin.

### Using ACLs in HAProxy
Once an ACL is defined, you can use it in directives like:

```
use_backend → Direct requests to a specific backend.
http-request deny → Block requests.
http-request redirect → Redirect requests.
```

Example: Routing Based on URL Path

```
frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    acl is_admin path_beg /admin
    use_backend admin_backend if is_admin
    default_backend main_backend
```

If the request path starts with /admin, traffic is sent to admin_backend.
Otherwise, requests go to main_backend.

### Common ACL Conditions
Condition	Description	Example

- path_beg:	Matches if the URL starts with a string	path_beg /api
- path_end:	Matches if the URL ends with a string	path_end .php
- hdr(host):	Matches the Host header	hdr(host) -i example.com
- src: Matches source IP address	src 192.168.1.0/24
- method:	Matches HTTP method	method GET
- ssl_fc:	Checks if the request uses HTTPS	ssl_fc

Example: Blocking a Specific IP

```
acl blocked_ip src 192.168.1.100
http-request deny if blocked_ip
```

This rule denies requests from 192.168.1.100.

Example: Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS
```
acl is_http ssl_fc false
http-request redirect scheme https if is_http
```
This forces HTTP requests to redirect to HTTPS.
