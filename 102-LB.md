# Load Balancing Algorithms in HAProxy

## 1. balance roundrobin
**Description:** Requests are distributed to servers in a circular order.  
**Use Case:** Best when all backend servers have similar capacity and performance.  
**Features:** 
- Easy to implement.  
- Ensures equal load distribution when servers are identical.  
**Limitations:** Doesn't account for server load or capacity.

---

## 2. balance leastconn
**Description:** Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections.  
**Use Case:** Useful for long-lived connections (e.g., databases or WebSocket).  
**Features:** Avoids overloading servers with many open connections.  
**Limitations:** Not ideal for short-lived connections or if backend capacities vary.

---

## 3. balance source
**Description:** Routes requests based on the hash of the client IP address.  
**Use Case:** Ideal for session persistence (stickiness) when you cannot store session data elsewhere.  
**Features:** Ensures the same client always reaches the same server.  
**Limitations:** Does not account for server load or dynamic environments.

## 4. balance uri
**Description:** Routes requests based on a hash of the request URI.  
**Use Case:** Best for caching scenarios where identical URIs should hit the same backend.  
**Features:** 
- Optimizes caching by directing identical requests to the same server.  
**Parameters:**  
- `len`: Number of characters in the URI to hash (default: full URI).  
- `depth`: Number of URI path levels to hash (default: all levels).  
**Example:**  
`balance uri len 10 depth 2`

## 5. balance hdr(<name>)
**Description:** Routes requests based on a hash of a specific HTTP header.  
**Use Case:** Useful for stickiness based on headers like User-Agent or custom headers.  
**Parameters:** Replace `<name>` with the name of the header.  
**Example:**  
`balance hdr(User-Agent)`

---

## 6. balance rdp-cookie(<name>)
**Description:** Routes requests based on an RDP cookie (used in Terminal Services environments).  
**Use Case:** Useful for Microsoft RDP services.  
**Parameters:** Replace `<name>` with the name of the RDP cookie.  
**Example:**  
`balance rdp-cookie(MSTS)`

---

## 7. balance random
**Description:** Routes requests randomly to backend servers.  
**Use Case:** Simple and useful for quick testing or very lightweight, stateless traffic.  
**Features:** Adds randomness but can lead to uneven distribution.

---

## 8. balance first
**Description:** Sends all traffic to the first server in the list that is healthy.  
**Use Case:** Specific use cases where only one backend needs to serve requests until it fails.

# HAProxy Key Functions and Parameters

### 1. Stickiness Settings
- **stick-table:** Allows maintaining sticky sessions based on client IP, cookies, or custom data.  
**Example:**  

```
stick-table type ip size 1m expire 30m store http_req_rate(10s)
```
stick on: Configures what to stick on.

Example:

```
stick on src
```

### 2. Timeouts

- **timeout** connect: Maximum time to wait for a connection to a backend server.
- **timeout** client: Maximum inactivity time on the client side.
- **timeout** server: Maximum inactivity time on the server side.
Example:

```
timeout connect 5s
timeout client 30s
timeout server 30s
```

### 3. Health Checks
- **option** httpchk: Enables health checks using HTTP requests.


option httpchk GET /health

- **default-server** : Sets default health-check parameters for backend servers.


```
default-server inter 3s fall 3 rise 2
```

### 4. ACL (Access Control Lists)
Allows fine-grained routing and decision-making.

```
acl is_static path_end .jpg .png
use_backend static_backend if is_static
```


### 5. Dynamic Server Weighting

```
server <name> <IP>:<port> weight <value>: Assigns a weight to a server for proportional load balancing.
```

Example:

```
server srv1 192.168.1.10:80 weight 50
server srv2 192.168.1.11:80 weight 100
```

### 6. Logging
log: Defines logging configuration.
Example:
```
log 127.0.0.1 local0 debug
```

### 7. Rate Limiting
http-request deny if: Blocks requests exceeding a defined rate.
Example:
```
http-request deny if { sc_http_req_rate(0) gt 10 }
```
